1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Wanna believe

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
That you don't have a bad bone in your body.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Wanna believe

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
That even when you're stone cold

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,500
You're sorry.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
I know you're chokin on your fears

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Already told you I'm right here

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will stay by your side every night

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't know why you hide from the one

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And close your eyes to the one

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mess up and lie to the one that you love

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When you know you can cry to the one

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Always confide in the one

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can be kind to the one that you love

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
