That even when you're stone cold

You're sorry.

I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Mess up and lie to the one that you love

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
When you know you can cry to the one

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Always confide in the one

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
You can be kind to the one that you love
